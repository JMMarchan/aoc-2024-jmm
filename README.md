# aoc-2023-jmm

This repository contains my Rust solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024),
using [agubelu/AoC-rust-template](https://github.com/agubelu/AoC-rust-template/tree/master).

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, use the `cargo run` command followed by one or more day numbers

```bash
cargo run --release -- [days...]
```

## Progress

- :star: = Complete solution
- :hammer_and_wrench: = Released challenge but incomplete solution
- :hourglass: = Unreleased challenge
